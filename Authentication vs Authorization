Authentication and Authorization are two related but distinct concepts in the context of security and access control:

Authentication:

- Verifies the identity of a user, device, or system
- Ensures that someone is who they claim to be
- Typically involves a login process, where credentials (username/password, biometrics, etc.) are checked against a stored database
- Grants access to a system, network, or application

Authorization:

- Determines what actions a user can perform once authenticated
- Defines what resources a user can access, and what actions they can take on those resources
- Controls the level of access and privileges granted to a user
- Ensures that a user only has access to what they need to do their job or perform a specific task

To illustrate the difference:

- Authentication is like verifying a person's identity at a party door (ensuring they are who they claim to be).
- Authorization is like granting access to specific areas of the party (controlling what they can do once inside).

In summary, authentication verifies who you are, while authorization determines what you can do.
